                    A bit about me...
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Hi, I'm Dean Parker. I'm a blues function musician originally from Reading. Here's where my story began...
                </p>
                <img src="assets/dean1.jpeg" class="hidden-xs dean1" alt="Dean Parker">
                <h3>
                    My Roots
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I had my first guitar lesson when I was 9, and had them through my school for about a year. After getting bored, my mum encouraged me to continue and asked my 
                    uncle to teach me. He did so for 6 months but had to stop, but by this time I was improving, and good enough/enjoyed it enough to not want to stop this time.
                    <br>I've been teaching myself ever since, both guitar and music theory, and have studied music for GCSE and A Level.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    My Experience
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I've played to live audiences of thousands, I have a bi-monthly gig at a local arts centre, and I'm a part of several local bands. I play the cajon regularly, and 
                    have dabbled in bass guitar too. I've played electric guitar to grade five standard, and learnt music theory to grade five too.
                    <br>I've been learning and performing since the age of 9, and so with over a decade of musical experience there's not much I haven't seen. But, what I think is 
                    most important, is that my love for music has never ceased!
                </p>
                <h3>
                    My Band
                </h3>
                <p>
                    My band is a blues trio, with acoustic guitar, vocals, bass guitar and drums. 
                    <span class="hidden-sm hidden-md hidden-lg"><br></span>We sometimes include keys, too.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Me, Dean Parker
                </h5>
                <p>
                   I lead the band on acoustic guitar and main vocals.
                   <br>I also play electric, bass, cajon, ukelele and harmonica.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Dennis Armstrong
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Dennis is my bassist and often sings backing vocals.
                    <br>He's a musician who never ceases to amaze me - always improving, always showing me the latest skill or 
                    technique he's learnt - and I've worked with him for almost 3 years now.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Paul Youngs
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Paul is my drummer.
                    <br>He's the best musician I've ever played with - he's an unnaturally natural musician. He's taught himself other instruments too, and is one of the best pianists 
                    I know.

                    wanted to. This is outside of the normal style of Dean Parker Blues Band, however they worked with our needs and more than met them.
                    <br>We were very impressed, and will be hiring them again.

                    and singing to the tunes they played. The whole evening was so special to me, one I'll always remember, and the entertainment the Dean Parker Blues Band provided 
                    meant the evening was enjoyable for all who came.

                    listening to her music. We asked Dean and his band to play her favourite songs, and he did that and more! You should have seen her face, when she came into the 
                    venue and Dean and his band started playing happy birthday for her friends to sing! Priceless! Thank you again. xx
